# Arduino-Scale
For my freshman engineering class I had to build a scale that was Arduino compatible. I used a 5kg load cell connected to a HX711 amplifier chip that communicated with the arduino. 

WHAT I LEARNED:
- What a load cell is and how to use one
- Became familiar with the HX711 IC
- Programming a load cell

MATERIALS USED:
- Load cell and HX711
- Some wood, screws, and nuts
- RedBoard
